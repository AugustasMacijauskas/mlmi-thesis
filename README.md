# Eliciting latent knowledge from language reward models

Code for my thesis titled "Eliciting latent knowledge from language reward models" for the MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of Cambridge.


## Usage

To be supplemented.


## Idea

Use methods that _discover latent knowledge_ (DLK), such as [CCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827), to build reward models that promote truthfulness. Utilize these reward models to execute _reinforcement learning_ (RL) fine-tuning to improve the "truthfulness" of LLMs.

More details to be provided.
